# NEAR Protocol Audit Search Patterns

This rule provides specific search patterns to use when auditing NEAR Protocol integrations.

## Key Functions and Patterns to Search For

### Smart Contract (JavaScript/TypeScript)
```
# NEP-141 Fungible Token Functions
ft_transfer
ft_transfer_call
ft_balance_of
ft_total_supply
ft_transfer_internal

# NEP-171 NFT Functions
nft_transfer
nft_mint
nft_token
nft_tokens
nft_tokens_for_owner

# Storage Management (NEP-145)
storage_deposit
storage_withdraw
storage_unregister

# Cross-Contract Calls
Promise
ext_contract
near.promiseBatchCreate
near.promiseBatchThen
near.promiseReturn
near.promiseCreate
NearPromise

# NEAR SDK Decorators
@call
@view
@NearBindgen
@payable
@private
@initialize

# Access Control
predecessor_account_id
signer_account_id
current_account_id
attached_deposit
```

### Frontend Integration
```
# Wallet Selector
@near-wallet-selector/core
useWalletSelector
setupWalletSelector
setupModal

# Transaction Submission
signAndSendTransaction
signTransaction
callFunction
viewFunction
FunctionCall

# NEAR API JS
near-api-js
providers.JsonRpcProvider
connect
keyStores
WalletConnection
Contract
utils.format
```

### Backend Integration
```
# Go/Backend Integration
FunctionCall
ViewFunction
GenerateWalletURL
TransactionRequest
CallMethod
SignTransaction
```

## File Patterns to Prioritize
- `contract.js`, `contract.ts`, `*.contract.js`, `*.contract.ts`
- `near.js`, `near.ts`, `near/*.js`, `near/*.ts`
- `wallet.js`, `wallet.ts`
- `*token*.js`, `*token*.ts` (for token contracts)
- `package.json` for dependencies like:
  - `near-sdk-js`
  - `near-api-js`
  - `@near-wallet-selector/*`
  - `near-cli`

## Common Integration Points
Check these key integration points:
- Contract deployment scripts
- Token management code
- User authentication with NEAR
- Transaction signing flows
- Contract call wrapper functions
- Error handling for NEAR transactions
- Network switching (mainnet/testnet)

When evaluating the codebase, use these specific patterns in grep searches and code analysis to quickly identify NEAR Protocol integration points.
